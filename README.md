# Window Manager

## Introduction

The Window Manager subsystem provides basic capabilities of window and display management. It is the basis for UI display. The following figure shows the architecture of the Window Manager subsystem.

- **Window Manager Client**

    Provides window object abstraction and window management interfaces, and connects to the ability and UI framework.

- **Display Manager Client**

    Provides display information abstraction and display management interfaces.

- **Window Manager Server**

    Provides capabilities such as window layout, Z-order control, window tree structure, window dragging, and window snapshot, and offers the window layout and focus window for multimodal input.

- **Display Manager Server**

    Provides display information, screenshot, screen on/off, and brightness processing control, and processes the mapping between the display and screen.
